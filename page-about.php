				<h1>About Sue</h1>
				<hr>
				
				<p>My passion for baking started at a young age helping my mother in the kitchen making cakes. 
				This progressed to me making cakes for my family, friends and later on my work colleagues.
				As my hobby in baking developed I continued to learn the finer points from learning the art of sugar craft,
				cake decorating and trying out my creations on friends and family which led to me leaving my long 
				career in nursing to follow my dream.</p>
				
				<p>For Sue at Cake Tiers it is not just about making a simple cake, it is all about taking a cake and 
				making it into something special for you that not only looks good but tastes good too!</p>
